 🛠 Circuit Design & Components
 The system consists of three primary stages: the Antenna, the Impedance Matching Network, and the Rectifier/Storage stage.

1. Antenna & Matching Network
Antenna: 6 cm Monopole.

L1 (Inductor): 4.7nH (used for resonance tuning).

C1 (Capacitor): 1pF.

C2 (Capacitor): 22pF.

2. Rectification Stage
D1, D2 (Diodes): 1N34A Germanium Diodes (Critical for high-frequency performance).

C3 (Capacitor): 2.2p F.

C4 (Capacitor): 10nF.

3. Output & Storage
D3 (Diode): 1N5819 Schottky Diode.

C5 (Storage): Electrolytic capacitor used to smooth the pulsating DC and store energy.

🔧 Hardware Implementation
The prototype was assembled on a copper-clad board using a "dead-bug" or point-to-point soldering technique to reduce parasitic capacitance, which is vital for high-frequency 2.4 GHz operation.
