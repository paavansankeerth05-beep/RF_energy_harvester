# RF_energy_harvester
This project demonstrates the design and hardware implementation of an RF Energy Harvesting (RFEH) system tuned for the 2.4 GHz band. The system captures ambient radio frequency energy (from Wi-Fi or Bluetooth signals) and converts it into a stable DC voltage to power low-power electronic devices or sensors.
# 🚀 Key Features
## Target Frequency: 
2.4 GHz (ISM Band).
## Antenna Design:
Monopole antenna (6 cm) optimized for Wi-Fi/Bluetooth reception.
## High Sensitivity: 
Utilizes Germanium diodes (1N34A) known for low forward voltage drop ($0.4\text{V} - 0.6\text{V}$), enabling the rectification of very weak RF signals.
## Impedance Matching:
Integrated LC matching network to maximize power transfer and minimize reflection losses.
