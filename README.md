# RF_energy_harvester
This project demonstrates the design and hardware implementation of an RF Energy Harvesting (RFEH) system tuned for the 2.4 GHz band. The system captures ambient radio frequency energy (from Wi-Fi or Bluetooth signals) and converts it into a stable DC voltage to power low-power electronic devices or sensors.
